Users are also given each representative's contact information if they want to pursue further actionable steps. This project won First Place at Disrupt the District.",

        "description": "The past few years have been rife with news about racial biases within AI algorithms. One of the primary problems with AI today is how it can manifest inherent human biases in actual applications. Most solutions to this problem usually deal with completely retooling individual AI algorithms to reduce bias. This is a very inefficient and resource-heavy approach for most companies. Our solution is to have an image/video preprocessor that normalizes faces before they are analyzed by AI. This allows our product to be easily injected and implemented into existing software stacks as a single discrete step.",
